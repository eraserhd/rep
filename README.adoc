rep
===

https://github.com/eraserhd/rep

A single-shot nREPL client designed for shell invocation.

This connects to a running nREPL server (like kind started with `lein repl`,
for example), sends some code to be evaluated, and prints the results and
output.

....
$ rep '(clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh)'
:reloading ()
:ok
....

Unlike other nREPL clients, `rep` does not try to maintain a persistent
connection, meaning that thread-local variables and bindings like `*e` and
`*1` will not persist across invocations of `rep`.  Perhaps there are
other limitations because of this?

Installation
------------

Download the latest Linux or MacOS binaries from the GitHub releases tab
above.

Usage, Options, and Examples
----------------------------

See https://github.com/eraserhd/rep/blob/develop/rep.1.adoc[the rep manpage].

Building
--------

https://nixos.org/nix/download.html[Nix] is the build tool. Weird, yes, but
this project has a brittle set of peculiar dependencies and Nix allows us to
pin down _everything_.

....
$ nix-build .
....

A `result` symlink will appear in the current directory point to the build
output.

Running Tests
-------------

If you want to add a feature, please add tests.  The nicest way to start
a REPL running tests is:

....
$ clj -A:test
Clojure 1.10.0-master-SNAPSHOT
user=> (use 'midje.repl)
Run `(doc midje)` for Midje usage.
Run `(doc midje-repl)` for descriptions of Midje repl functions.
nil
user=> (autotest)

======================================================================
Loading (rep.test-drivers rep.format-test rep.core-test)
nil
All checks (36) succeeded.
[Completed at 22:56:48]
true
user=>
....

To run all the tests that CI runs, the way CI runs them (do this before
issuing a pull request):

....
$ nix-build release.nix
....

Using with Kakoune
------------------

The `rc/` folder contains scripts which add a `,e` user mode to Kakoune.  To
link this to Kakoiune's autoload directory, do the following:

....
$ make install
....

`rep` must be in the path for the plugin to work.

Graal/Bytecode Issues
---------------------

At the moment, Graal doesn't deal well with the way Clojure generates bytecode
from its 'locking' macro, so to build bytecode that Graal can handle, we need
to apply https://dev.clojure.org/jira/secure/attachment/18767/clj-1472-3.patch[this patch].
This issue is being tracked
https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1472[here] and
https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/861[here].
